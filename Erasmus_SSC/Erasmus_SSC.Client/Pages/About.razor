    The project “Sustainable Skills in Construction” focuses on raising awareness of sustainability within the construction sector by fostering a sustainable mindset among VET (Vocational Education and Training) students and staff.
    Its goal is to strengthen key competencies through innovative learning environments and targeted training, improve circular building practices, and promote social inclusion.
    By bringing together diverse expertise from across Europe, the project aims to transform both the technical and social dimensions of sustainability in vocational education related to construction.

    The expected outcomes include enhanced sustainability competencies among VET students and staff, the creation of innovative teaching resources, and the development of a micro-credential course in green construction.
    Furthermore, the project will contribute to better integration of sustainability topics into vocational curricula, increased opportunities for international mobility, and stronger partnerships between educational institutions and the construction industry.
